This is a Latex class for the generation of some documents for Scientists for Future Frankfurt am Main. Content is free, feel free to copy modify or simply use in any way. The Logo "Scientists for Future Frankfurt" has a cc license as described in https://scientists4future.org/charta

The class bases on the komascript class scrartcl and uses the following addtitional packages 

- sectsty
- xcolor
- setspace
- babel (german)
- hyperref
- array
- multirow
- graphicx
- fontspec
- geometry
- fancyhdr
- lastpage

The font Montserrat is loaded via fontspec. Hence the font needs to be available in the local Latex font cache and compilation may not be done with PDFLatex as it does not support fontspec.
